```built``` provides a crate with information from the time it was built.

`built` is used as a build-time dependency to collect various information
about the build-environment, serialize this information into Rust-code and
provide that to the crate. The information collected by `built` include:

* Various metadata like version, authors, homepage etc. as set by `Cargo.toml`
* The tag or commit id if the crate was being compiled from within a Git repository.
* The values of `CARGO_CFG_*` build script environment variables, like `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS` and `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH` (unless feature `skip-environment` is specified).
* The features the crate was compiled with.
* The various dependencies, dependencies of dependencies and their versions Cargo ultimately chose to compile.
* The presence of a CI-platform like `Github Actions`, `Travis CI` and `AppVeyor`.
* The compiler and it's version; the documentation-generator and it's version.

See [the example](https://github.com/lukaslueg/built/tree/master/example_project) or the [docs](https://docs.rs/built) for more information.
