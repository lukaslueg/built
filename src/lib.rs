#![allow(clippy::needless_doctest_main)]

//! Provides a crate with information from the time it was built.
//!
//! `built` is used as a build-time dependency to collect various information
//! about the build-environment, serialize this information into Rust-code and
//! provide that to the crate. The information collected by `built` include:
//!
//!  * Various metadata like version, authors, homepage etc. as set by `Cargo.toml`
//!  * The tag or commit id if the crate was being compiled from within a Git repository.
//!  * The values of `CARGO_CFG_*` build script environment variables, like `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS` and `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH`.
//!  * The features the crate was compiled with.
//!  * The various dependencies, dependencies of dependencies and their versions Cargo ultimately chose to compile.
//!  * The presence of a CI-platform like `Github Actions`, `Travis CI` and `AppVeyor`.
//!  * The compiler and it's version; the documentation-generator and it's version.
//!
//! `built` does not add any further runtime-dependencies to a crate; all information
//! is serialized as types from `stdlib`. One can include `built` as a
//! runtime-dependency and use it's convenience functions.
//!
//! To add `built` to a crate, add it as a build-time dependency, use a build-script
//! to collect and serialize the build-time information, and `include!` the generated code.
//!
//! Add this to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [package]
//! build = "build.rs"
//!
//! [build-dependencies]
//! built = "0.8"
//! ```
//!
//! Add or modify a build-script. In `build.rs`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! fn main() {
//!     built::write_built_file().expect("Failed to acquire build-time information");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The build-script will by default write a file named `built.rs` into Cargo's output
//! directory. It can be picked up in `main.rs` (or anywhere else) like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Use of a mod or pub mod is not actually necessary.
//! pub mod built_info {
//!    // The file has been placed there by the build script.
//!    include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/built.rs"));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ...and then used somewhere in the crate's code:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # mod built_info {
//! #    pub static PKG_VERSION_PRE: &str = "";
//! #    pub static CI_PLATFORM: Option<&str> = None;
//! #    pub static GIT_VERSION: Option<&str> = None;
//! #    pub static DEPENDENCIES: [(&str, &str); 0] = [];
//! #    pub static BUILT_TIME_UTC: &str = "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:21:41 GMT";
//! # }
//! #
//! # enum LogLevel { TRACE, ERROR };
//! /// Determine if current version is a pre-release or was built from a git-repo
//! fn release_is_unstable() -> bool {
//!     return !built_info::PKG_VERSION_PRE.is_empty() || built_info::GIT_VERSION.is_some()
//! }
//!
//! /// Default log-level, enhanced on CI
//! fn default_log_level() -> LogLevel {
//!     if built_info::CI_PLATFORM.is_some() {
//!         LogLevel::TRACE
//!     } else {
//!         LogLevel::ERROR
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! /// The time this crate was built
//! #[cfg(feature = "chrono")]
//! fn built_time() -> built::chrono::DateTime<built::chrono::Local> {
//!     built::util::strptime(built_info::BUILT_TIME_UTC)
//!         .with_timezone(&built::chrono::offset::Local)
//! }
//!
//! /// If another crate pulls in a dependency we don't like, print a warning
//! #[cfg(feature = "semver")]
//! fn check_sane_dependencies() {
//!     if built::util::parse_versions(&built_info::DEPENDENCIES)
//!                     .any(|(name, ver)| name == "DeleteAllMyFiles"
//!                                        && ver < built::semver::Version::parse("1.1.4").unwrap()) {
//!         eprintln!("DeleteAllMyFiles < 1.1.4 may not delete all your files. Beware!");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ## Overrides
//!
//! Most values otherwise detected by `built` can be manually set using environment variables. The
//! primary use-case for this is to allow automated build-systems and package-managers to enforce
//! certain values, e.g. to hide the presence of a CI-platform and/or allow for reproducible
//! builds.
//!
//! The values set via the environment take precedence over what `built` would otherwise detect.
//! There is no mechanism to ensure that values derived from override-variables are sensible,
//! besides enforcing the correct type.
//!
//! Override-variables are prefixed by `BUILT_OVERRIDE_{PKG_NAME}_`, where `{PKG_NAME}` is the name
//! of the package as reported by `cargo`. For example, if the package is named "mypkg", and the value
//! to be overridden is named "CI_PLATFORM", then the override variable is named
//! "BUILT_OVERRIDE_mypkg_CI_PLATFORM". Remember that more than one package in a dependency-graph
//! might use `built` internally, so you might have to override multiple instances of the same
//! value.
//! Unused override variables result in a warning at compile time, albeit cargo only reports those
//! for path-specific (e.g. local) packages.
//!
//! An override-variable's text-presentation must parse to the value's respective type:
//! * Strings are used as-is.
//! * Integers and `bool` must parse via their `std::str::FromStr`-implementation.
//! * `std::option::Option<T>` parses the string `BUILT_OVERRIDE_NONE` as `Option::None`; every other value
//!   must parse as `T`. For example, `BUILT_OVERRIDE_mypkg_CI_PLATFORM=BUILT_OVERRIDE_NONE` forces
//!   `CI_PLATFORM.is_none()`.
//! * List-like values are parsed as comma-separated values.
//!
//! If an override-variable can't be parsed, the build-process will abort with a `panic!()`.
//!
//! Notice that values that were overridden are recorded in `OVERRIDE_VARIABLES_USED`.
//!
//! Please refer to the respective item's documentation for more information on overrides.
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//! The information that `built` collects and makes available in `built.rs` depends
//! on the features that were enabled on the build-time dependency.
//!
//! ### _Always available_
//! The following information is available regardless of feature-flags.
//!
//! ```
//! /// The Continuous Integration platform detected during compilation.

//!
//! ### `cargo-lock`
//! Parses `Cargo.lock`and generates representations of  dependencies and their versions.
//!
//! For this to work, `Cargo.lock` needs to actually be there; this is (usually)
//! only true for executables and not for libraries. Cargo will only create a
//! `Cargo.lock` for the top-level crate in a dependency-tree. In case
//! of a library, the top-level crate will decide which crate/version
//! combination to compile and there will be no `Cargo.lock` while the library
//! gets compiled as a dependency.
//!
//! Parsing `Cargo.lock` instead of `Cargo.toml` allows to serialize the
//! precise versions Cargo chose to compile. One can't, however, distinguish
//! `build-dependencies`, `dev-dependencies` and `dependencies`. Furthermore,
//! some dependencies never show up if Cargo had not been forced to
//! actually use them (e.g. `dev-dependencies` with `cargo test` never
//! having been executed).
//!
//! Note that if the `dependency-tree`-feature is not active, the list of dependencies
//! contains the root-package(s) as well.
//!
