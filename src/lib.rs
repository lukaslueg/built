#![allow(clippy::needless_doctest_main)]

//! Provides a crate with information from the time it was built.
//!
//! `built` is used as a build-time dependency to collect various information
//! about the build-environment, serialize this information into Rust-code and
//! provide that to the crate. The information collected by `built` include:
//!
//!  * Various metadata like version, authors, homepage etc. as set by `Cargo.toml`
//!  * The tag or commit id if the crate was being compiled from within a Git repository.
//!  * The values of `CARGO_CFG_*` build script environment variables, like `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_OS` and `CARGO_CFG_TARGET_ARCH`.
//!  * The features the crate was compiled with.
//!  * The various dependencies, dependencies of dependencies and their versions Cargo ultimately chose to compile.
//!  * The presence of a CI-platform like `Github Actions`, `Travis CI` and `AppVeyor`.
//!  * The compiler and it's version; the documentation-generator and it's version.
//!
//! `built` does not add any further runtime-dependencies to a crate; all information
//! is serialized as types from `stdlib`. One can include `built` as a
//! runtime-dependency and use it's convenience functions.
//!
//! To add `built` to a crate, add it as a build-time dependency, use a build-script
//! to collect and serialize the build-time information, and `include!` the generated code.
//!
//! Add this to `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [package]
//! build = "build.rs"
//!
//! [build-dependencies]
//! built = "0.7"
//! ```
//!
//! Add or modify a build-script. In `build.rs`:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! fn main() {
//!     built::write_built_file().expect("Failed to acquire build-time information");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The build-script will by default write a file named `built.rs` into Cargo's output
//! directory. It can be picked up in `main.rs` (or anywhere else) like this:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! // Use of a mod or pub mod is not actually necessary.
//! pub mod built_info {
//!    // The file has been placed there by the build script.
//!    include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/built.rs"));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ...and then used somewhere in the crate's code:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # mod built_info {
//! #    pub static PKG_VERSION_PRE: &str = "";
//! #    pub static CI_PLATFORM: Option<&str> = None;
//! #    pub static GIT_VERSION: Option<&str> = None;
//! #    pub static DEPENDENCIES: [(&str, &str); 0] = [];
//! #    pub static BUILT_TIME_UTC: &str = "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:21:41 GMT";

//! fn release_is_unstable() -> bool {

//! }
//!
//! /// Default log-level, enhanced on CI
//! fn default_log_level() -> LogLevel {

//!                                        && ver < built::semver::Version::parse("1.1.4").unwrap()) {
//!         eprintln!("DeleteAllMyFiles < 1.1.4 may not delete all your files. Beware!");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Feature flags
//! The information that `built` collects and makes available in `built.rs` depends
//! on the features that were enabled on the build-time dependency.
//!

//!
//! ### `cargo-lock`
//! Parses `Cargo.lock`and generates representations of  dependencies and their versions.
//!
//! For this to work, `Cargo.lock` needs to actually be there; this is (usually)
//! only true for executables and not for libraries. Cargo will only create a
//! `Cargo.lock` for the top-level crate in a dependency-tree. In case
//! of a library, the top-level crate will decide which crate/version
//! combination to compile and there will be no `Cargo.lock` while the library
//! gets compiled as a dependency.
//!
//! Parsing `Cargo.lock` instead of `Cargo.toml` allows to serialize the
//! precise versions Cargo chose to compile. One can't, however, distinguish
//! `build-dependencies`, `dev-dependencies` and `dependencies`. Furthermore,
//! some dependencies never show up if Cargo had not been forced to
//! actually use them (e.g. `dev-dependencies` with `cargo test` never
//! having been executed).
//!
//! Note that if the `dependency-tree`-feature is not active, the list of dependencies
//! contains the root-package(s) as well.
//!
//! ```

//! Try to open the git-repository at `manifest_location` and retrieve `HEAD`

//! Notice that `GIT_HEAD_REF` is `None` if `HEAD` is detached or not valid UTF-8.

//! Continuous Integration platforms like `Travis` and `AppVeyor` will

//! result. `GIT_VERSION` and `GIT_DIRTY` will therefore always be `None` if
//! a CI-platform is detected.
//! ```
//! /// If the crate was compiled from within a git-repository,

//! /// if HEAD is not tagged.

//! ```
//!
//! ### `chrono`
//!
//! The build-time is recorded as `BUILT_TIME_UTC`. If `built` is included as a runtime-dependency,
//! it can parse the string-representation into a `time:Tm` with the help of
//! `built::util::strptime()`.
//!
//! `built` honors the environment variable `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`. If the variable is defined and
//! parses to a valid UTC timestamp, that build-time is used instead of the current local time.
//! The variable is silently ignored if defined but but does not parse to a valid UTC timestamp.
//!
//! ```
//! /// The built-time in RFC2822, UTC
